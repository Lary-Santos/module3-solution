                It looked like rain. The sky was gray. It was almost noon, but the sun was hidden by a gray blanket. It was cool. There were no birds flying anywhere.
                A couple of birds sat on the telephone wire. Bob was standing outside talking to Bill. They both had their hands in their pockets. They knew that it was
                probably going to rain shortly. A sudden breeze blew some leaves off a tree onto the sidewalk.
                A young woman wearing a dark blue coat and jeans walked by. She was walking a small dog. It was pure white, and pretty. It sniffed at a tree trunk. The woman
                waited patiently. Finally, the dog lifted its leg. 
                Bob said that he liked the rain. It was a nice change from the usual hot Los Angeles weather. And the plants could always use the extra water. Bill said the
                only thing he didnt like about rain was that all the motor oil on the streets would get washed into the ocean, and so would all the trash.
                “But that never stops the surfers,” Bob said. “They dont seem to care whats in the water, as long as there are waves to surf on.
                Peter got out of bed feeling sad. He was tired of living and wanted to die. He would even ask people around him to help him die. They made suggestions, because 
                they thought he was joking. One said that he should overdose on medicine; the other simply offered him a noose. Peter was not satisfied with their answers. Then, Peter
                asked Sarah. Sarah was pretty and always smiling to everyone she talked to. She even talked to Peter, who was usually gloomy. Peter asked Sarah about how he should kill
                himself. Sarah just beamed and smiled at him sincerely. With that, Peter had a change of heart. Suddenly he was not filled with grief. Instead, he had a new purpose. Sarah
                did not help him die, she helped him find a reason to live.<a href="#back-top">Back to Top</a>
